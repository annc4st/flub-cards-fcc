# flub-cards-fcc

Mini web application that helped me understand processing datasets, and then outputting information to the screen,  how to work with DOM manipulation, object destructuring, event handling, and data filtering.

This project will cover concepts like switch statements, default parameters, Object.freeze(), the map(), filter() methods, and more.
